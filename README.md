# Landing Page Project

# this is a landing page and there are 5 sections with an active style 

# you can scroll to the section by your mouse or keyboard or you can just click on the section number at the navbar list

# that's code written with java script i used   "for of - arrays - addEventListener - functions" 

# you can run the page on your computer ,laptop , tablet and your mobile 

# when i get stuck i search for the information on W3school and MDN and i asked my course mates for help or i revised my classroom lessons


# i used MDN and W3school as references to do my landing page
